# sanityTracker

An R-Package that keeps track of all performed sanity checks.

During the preparation of data set(s) one usually performs some sanity
checks. The idea is that irrespective of where the checks are performed,
they are centralized by this package in order to list all at once with
examples if a check failed.

## Example

Assume you process a data set and you have different functions for
certain aspects. Within those functions you can make some checks,
document what you did, what the outcome of the check was and store some
examples where the check failed. At the end you can summarize the
performed checks (that might be scattered all over our source code) and
their outcomes.

For illustration we consider a very simple data set:

``` r
raw_data
#>   id      start        end height_m
#> 1  1 2020-04-12 2020-03-13     1.77
#> 2  2 2010-01-20 2020-01-26   144.00
#> 3  3 2020-02-20 2020-03-01     1.89
#> 4  4 2020-01-23 2020-01-26     1.74
```

We have two simple data-preparation function for our raw-data-set:

``` r
correct_height <- function(raw_data) {
  ret <- raw_data
  sc <- sanityTracker::add_sanity_check(
    fail_vec = 100 < ret$height_m,
    description = "Persons are smaller than 100m",
    counter_meas = "Divide by 100. Assume height is given in cm",
    param_name = "height_m",
    data = ret
  )
  if (sc[["fail"]]) {
    ret$height_m[sc[["fail_vec"]]] <- ret$height_m[sc[["fail_vec"]]] / 100
  }
  
  
  sanityTracker::add_sanity_check(
    fail_vec = 2.5 < ret$height_m,
    description = "Persons are smaller than 2.5m",
    data = ret
  )  
  return(ret)
}

prep <- function(raw_data) {

  sanityTracker::add_sanity_check(
    fail_vec = duplicated(raw_data$id),
    description = "No duplicated ids",
    data = raw_data
  )
  
  raw_data$start <- as.Date(raw_data$start)
  raw_data$end <- as.Date(raw_data$end)
  sanityTracker::add_sanity_check(
    fail_vec = raw_data$end < raw_data$start,
    description = "start-date <= end-date",
    data = raw_data
  )

  ret <- correct_height(raw_data = raw_data)  
  return(ret)
}
```

After applying the prep-function we can summarize the sanity checks

``` r
wrangled_data <- prep(raw_data = raw_data)
sanity_checks <- sanityTracker::get_sanity_checks()
sanity_checks
#>                      description n n_fail n_na
#> 1:             No duplicated ids 4      0    0
#> 2:        start-date <= end-date 4      1    0
#> 3: Persons are smaller than 100m 4      1    0
#> 4: Persons are smaller than 2.5m 4      0    0
#>                                   counter_meas                  fail_vec_str
#> 1:                                        None       duplicated(raw_data$id)
#> 2:                                        None raw_data$end < raw_data$start
#> 3: Divide by 100. Assume height is given in cm            100 < ret$height_m
#> 4:                                        None            2.5 < ret$height_m
#>    param_name                                call      example
#> 1:          -           prep(raw_data = raw_data)             
#> 2:          -           prep(raw_data = raw_data) <data.frame>
#> 3:   height_m correct_height(raw_data = raw_data) <data.frame>
#> 4:          - correct_height(raw_data = raw_data)
```

This directly gives an overview of what was performed which check failed
how often what counter measure was done and in case of a fail also
random rows (by default at most 3) of the data set where the check
failed.

``` r
sanity_checks[2, ]
#>               description n n_fail n_na counter_meas
#> 1: start-date <= end-date 4      1    0         None
#>                     fail_vec_str param_name                      call
#> 1: raw_data$end < raw_data$start          - prep(raw_data = raw_data)
#>         example
#> 1: <data.frame>
sanity_checks[2, ]$example
#> [[1]]
#>   id      start        end height_m
#> 1  1 2020-04-12 2020-03-13     1.77
```
